# Build Fun AI Projects that Run on the Web

This is the official repo for my series of books titled: Build Fun AI Projects that Run on the Web

## Description

Each work book is meant to help you to develop an AI project that can be deployed and run on the web just by using a browser. The only things you will need to complete these projects are GitHub, a computer with internet access and a browser, this work book, and some willingness to learn and fave fun. 

## Motivation

I love to tinker in my basement. I am always building puzzles, clocks, electronics kits, RC planes, recently I 3D printed an Antikythera, etc. You get the picture. I just like to learn by doing and building. In my professional life I practice data science consulting and teach about AI and machine learning at a University. For years I have looked for fun AI projects one can build and learn from similar to my previously described basement hobbies. However, I have not found many. This is probably because of the nature of AI and machine learning. In the past, you needed lots of tools to install on your computer, didn't really know where to even begin, and you basically reported lots of statistics about the trained AI models and that was it. But you didn't have that rewarding feeling of building something like with RC planes or hobby electronics. This, however, is about to change thanks to PyScript and other tools being made available everyday. 

With PyScript you can now build and learn about AI and machine learning, and you can also do it all in the web browser with just GitHub. And the fun aspect of this is that when you are done with your project, you will have a working AI tool that runs in the web from anywhere. Wow! What a time we live in. So, since I could not find these AI hobby projects as I wanted them, I decided to build them. This book is the first one in a series of AI project books I plan to create. Hopefully, now your list and my list of home hobby projects will also include AI models that run on the Web!
